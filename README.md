 This is some code I produced while playing around with the Titanic data set on Kaggle.
 Feel free to do what you like with it, hopefully you'll find something useful, and I'd
 be happy to hear where it could be improved.
 
 This repo contains the files:
 
  - TitanicNonTutorial.Rmd
  - figure/fig_age.png
  - figure/fig_learning.png
 
 You can produce an HTML file from the Rmd with the command:
  
  ```
  knit("TitanicNonTutorial.Rmd")
  ```
 
 This should also produce graphics similar to those in the `figure` directory.


 You will need the test.csv and train.csv files
 (downloaded from Kaggle) to be in the same directory.
