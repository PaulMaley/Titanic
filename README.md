 This is some code I produced while playing around with the Titanic data set on Kaggle.
 Feel free to do what you like with it, hopefully you'll find something useful, and I'd
 be happy to hear where it could be improved.
 
 This repo contains the files:
  
  - TitanicNonTutorial.Rmd  
  - TitanicNonTutorial.md
  - figure/fig_age.png
  - figure/fig_learning.png 
 
  The md file is produced from the Rmd with the command:
  
  ```
  knit("TitanicNonTutorial.Rmd")
  ```

You will need the test.csv and train.csv files 
(downloaded from Kaggle) to be in the same directory.
