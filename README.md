 This is some code I produced while playing around with the Titanic data set on Kaggle.
 Feel free to do what you like with it, hopefully you'll find something useful, and I'd
 be happy to hear where it could be improved.
 
 This repo contains two files:
  
  - TitanicNonTutorial.Rnd  
  - TitanicNonTutorial.HTML
  
  The second file is produced from the first with the command:
  
  ```
  knit("TitanicNonTutorial.Rmd", output="TitanicNonTutorial.html")
  ```
